# GeoCam

GeoCam is a prototype camera application developed by the Institute for Geoinformatics at the University of MÃ¼nster. The project addresses the growing challenge of verifying the authenticity of digital media, particularly in the context of misinformation and manipulated images.

## Key Features

- Capture cryptographically signed and geotagged images
- Visual feedback and verification workflows
- Integration with a backend for key management and media validation
- Modular architecture for handling camera input, capture sessions, and secure processing

## Project Structure

Below is an overview of the main directories and their responsibilities:

- **AVCamApp.swift**  
  Entry point of the SwiftUI application.

- **Capture/**  
  Contains lower-level AVFoundation logic for photo and video capture. Includes:
  - `PhotoCapture.swift` for managing AVFoundation capture outputs.

- **Model/**  
  Core data types and state management. Includes:
  - `CameraState.swift` for managing camera state transitions.
  - `KeyManager.swift` for handling public/private keys.
  - `QRSteganography.swift` for embedding metadata in QR codes and hiding them using steganography.

- **Support/**  
  General-purpose utilities and shared services. Includes:
  - `APIService.swift` for backend communication.
  - `SessionManager.swift` and `SignInManager.swift` for session and authentication logic.
  - `SecKey_PEM.swift` and `SevenHasher.swift` for cryptographic support.

- **Views/**  
  The SwiftUI-based user interface. Includes:
  - `CameraUI.swift` and `CameraPreview.swift` for live camera interaction.
  - `VerificationViewController.swift` and related files for image verification.
  - `Toolbars/` and `Overlays/` for user controls and real-time visual feedback.

## Local Installation

To run GeoCam locally with a custom backend, you must specify the IP address of your backend server.

1. Open `APIService.swift`
2. Locate the following section (lines 56 to 59):

    ```swift
    static var baseURL: String {
        return "http://192.168.178.42:10000" // ONLY CHANGE IP ADDRESS, NO NEED TO CHANGE PORT
    }
    ```

3. Replace `192.168.178.42` with the IP address of the computer running your backend service. The port should remain `10000`.

Make sure both your iOS device and backend server are on the same local network.
